Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

  For project two I wrote code to address creating each episode, epoch loops, when it should switch between random moves or the quality algorithm. The Project came with the Keras and dependent libraries as well as the model structure used in the neural network. The project 
  also already had controllers for default variables that the model parameter and the number of episodes use to initiate the treasure hunter program.



Waht do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

  As someone in computer science, I work to create solutions that are both intuitive and efficient in benefiting mankind through the use of computers. Thoughout this course I have worked to deepen my knowledge of AI and how it plays a role in the future of computer science. 
  With this knowledge I can bring automation and simplicity to computer programs by implementing AI in future projects. 



How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

  As a computer scientist I approach solving a problem by asking how I can improve this, how does my solution work to benefit others, are there other solutions that work better, and is my solution ethical. By asking these questions I can ensure that that what I’m doing is     
  right, beneficial to everyone, and not ethically harmful.



What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

  Following regulations put in place like the EU's GDPR, the protection of people’s data and how it’s used is an ethical responsibility of everyone in a computer science role. Protecting a user’s best interests is just as important as the codes functionality. Ethics are  
  especially important when working with a user’s data, for example data should only be used on a as needed basis, anonymized when available, and secured to prevent unauthorized access.
